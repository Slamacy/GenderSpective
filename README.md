# GenderSpective
GenderSpective was created for CitizenSchool’s “Serious Gaming for a Better Europe” mobility event at Artesis Plantin University College Antwerp from 15th - 26th of March 2018

The game was created using Javascript, html and css.
We used Netbeans, Android Studio, and Cordova to get the app to work on a phone.
